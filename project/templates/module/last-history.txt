 - wszst/wkmpt CHECK: Hints about self linked item routes and item routes with
   exact 1 point. A warning is printed when both events apply for same route.
 - Bug fix: The number of tables is set to 6 if writing a short binary
   item-slot file (without tables for battles).
 - wszst TEXT/BINARY: New options to patch KMG files: --kmg-limit=seconds to
   limit the run time of battles and --kmg-copy=id to copy one slot definition
   to the 9 other slots.
 - Leseratte and I analysed the MKW internal VR calculations and adapted the
   results into the tools. So the calculations are 100% identical now.
 - Command wszst VR-RACE supports now up to 30 players for the VR calculation.
 - KMP/CAME type 6 and the related route is excluded from any transformation.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
