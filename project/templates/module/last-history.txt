 - Windows only: 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Cygwin are supported now.
   The 64 bit version is recommended.
    - 32 bit version: Cygwin DLL 3.0.7 / 2019-04-30
    - 64 bit version: Cygwin DLL 3.1.7 / 2020-08-22
 - Support of LE-CODE build 25:
    - Speedometer support for LPAR-files.
    - New option for wlect: --speedometer=off/on
 - Again fewer program crashes when reading faulty SZS files. 
 - BMG supports little endian files now, but only encoding UTF-8 was checked.
   I need example files to verify other encodings (CP-1252,UTF-16,SHIFT-JIS).
 - KCL/OBJ: Faces with any number of vertices are accepted now. Before there
   was a limit of 50 vertices.
 - Bug fix for CT-CODE/LE-CODE configuration file: Command 'S' stored a slot
   number as single byte, so that only values between 0 and 255 were possible.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
